Buildr is build on top of rake, "the ruby make", and ruby. Buildr keeps maven good habits (repositories, standard sources layout, standard commands such as compile, test, install...) but remains a simple and easy to extend tool.

We will see concrete exemples of real buildfiles. We will also see what benefits are brought by rake and all the possibilities available with the ruby language.

A few before/after maven and buildr examples :
* telecom project : build goes from 12 min to 2 min : feedback is faster and clearer. The team now dares to dramatically improves its product.
* video projet : build shrinks from 14000 SLOC (maven 1) to 800 : release duration and risk dramatically reduced on a very risky project.

buildr is available at buildr.apache.org : an active and open community in the US and in Europe.
